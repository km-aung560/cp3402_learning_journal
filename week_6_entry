Week 6

Learning Activities & Resources

This week I was introduced to the Daily Stand-up and project management for the upcoming assignment. 
After learning the basic steps of daily stand-ups, I wanted to know more detail about its practices and methods.

This Youtube video is a great real-life demonstration of an unacceptable stand-up meeting, compared to an acceptable example of a stand-up meeting.

This article explains daily stand-ups in more detail and describes how these meetings work in a particular company.

I noticed that the project management tools needed for the assignment had aspects of the Agile framework. With prior experience with Agile, it has been an effective framework for development and I am happy to use it again.


Career/Employability/Learning Insights

The demonstration I found on Youtube was more suited towards an industry-level project with 5+ members. My upcoming project will include a smaller version of a stand-up meeting and will prepare me for projects in industry.
It was insightful to see the methods used to organise a stand-up meeting with a large industry team.
