# Week 7

## Learning Activities and Resources

This week I learned PHP programming for database and CMS development aspects. As I already learned basic PHP syntax and conventions in the past few weeks, I was prepared to practice more advanced aspects of PHP for CMS development. An important piece of advice from my tutor is to determine the minimum amount of content to learn in order to succeed. 

This LinkedIn course is 5 hours long but I avoid doing all of it by choosing the most important topics for my project; *Building Forms*, *My SQL Basics* and *Using PHP to Access MySQL*.

Many subjects can be very broad
