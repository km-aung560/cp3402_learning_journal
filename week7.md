# Week 7

## Learning Activities and Resources

This week I learned PHP programming for database and CMS development aspects. As I already learned basic PHP syntax and conventions in the past few weeks, I was prepared to practice more advanced aspects of PHP for development. An important piece of advice from my tutor is to determine the minimum amount of learning to succeed. 

This LinkedIn course is 5 hours long including topics I already learnt. I only do the most important topics for the project; *Building Forms*, *My SQL Basics*, *PHP to Access MySQL* and *CRUD with PHP*.

## Estimated Hours - 3 hours

I spent around *2 hours* on LinkedIn videos, plus *1 hour* improving my PHP skills. Group work time is not included.

## Content Insights

After learning about PHP for databases, I recognised a lot of similarities to Javascript. I have good experience with this language in web development and this may be the reason I had no trouble learning PHP. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

It is important to not waste time learning unnessesary things as it may not be useful for a particular goal. Many subjects are very broad and it is easy to get distracted from the important things. From this experience, I have better awareness and control over my own learning and this will help me in my career path.
