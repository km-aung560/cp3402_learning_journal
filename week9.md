After watching the course, I understood variables and nesting well because both behave the same way in the programming languages I learned. I learned that @extend simplifies your css code by specifying a 'parent' class which can be used to create multiple 'child' classes. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule.

While I was implementing the @mixin directive in my demo website, it was not displaying. I soon learned that I needed an @include statement to display the mixin code. I may have missed this in my learning activities.
