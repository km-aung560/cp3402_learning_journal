## Content Insights

After watching the course, I understood SASS variables and nesting well because both behave the same way in languages like Python and PHP. My understanding of @extend is that it simplifies your css by specifying a single 'parent' class to create multiple 'child' classes. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

While building my demo website, my @mixin code was not displaying. I soon learned that I needed an @include statement to display the mixin code.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

SASS is an extension to improve CSS efficiency and readability which is beneficial for web development. However I am not sure if I will take this path in my career. My experience with SASS may translate to other skills. By using new tools and technologies, I could improve and refine my current skills to eventually master them. This is important in long-term career development.
