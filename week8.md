## Learning Experiment

The purpose of this experiment is to prove a method based on a form of learning. To do this, an 'assumption' must be made to prove and disprove using a test, called a Hypothesis.

Hypothesis: If I study with music, then I will retain more information because the constant background noise will keep me focused on the task.


**Procedure:**
1. Choose two lessons that are similar in content and difficulty. The lessons must have its own corresponding quiz.
2. Conduct the first lesson without music, then complete its quiz. Record the time taken for both activities.
4. Conduct the second lesson with music (preferrably ambient/instrumental music), then complete its quiz. Record the time taken for both activities.
5. Record both quiz scores (quantitative)
6. Record your experiences and feelings in both tests (qualitative)

I have chosen the Codecademy lessons *HTML Form Handling in PHP* and *PHP Classes and Objects*. The music I have chosen is LoFi Hip Hop (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk).

**Results:**

First lesson - 20 mins\
First quiz - 2 mins - 7/7 correct

Second lesson - 36 mins\
Second quiz - 4 mins 15 secs - 4/8 correct

**Observations/Experiences/Reflections:**

First lesson - I was quite confident in my performance for this lesson. I had no trouble reading and learning the concepts. I was focused most of the time.

Second lesson - I lost focus multiple times whilst trying to read and learn the concepts. Most of the time spent in the lesson was re-reading the concepts due to losing focus. This is why the second lesson took longer to complete. I was the most focused doing the coding activities.

**Conclusion**

After conducting the test, the hypothesis is disproven. It has been revealed that I do learn better and retain more information without music. My learning performance was significantly affected with music playing in the background and this was evident in my quiz results. I assumed the music would keep me focused when it was the opposite in reality. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After the experiment, I learned that basic scientific methods can be used in other fields and everyday life. These science methods could be used for product/software development or writing reports in industry. I am familiar with similar methods like code testing and user testing in design, but I am unsure if I will use a formal scientific method of testing in the future.
