## Learning Activities

Hypothesis: If I study without music, then I will retain more information compared to studying with music because the extra background noise will distract me.

Procedure: 
1. Choose two lessons that are similar in content and difficulty. The content must be something not learned before or not revised in a long time. The lessons must have its own corresponding quiz.
2. Conduct the first lesson without music, then complete its quiz
3. Conduct the second lesson with music (preferrably ambient/instrumental music), then complete its quiz
4. Compare both quiz scores (quantitative)
5. Compare your experiences and feelings in both tests (qualitative)

I have chosen the Codecademy lessons *HTML Form Handling in PHP* and *PHP Form Validation*. The music I have chosen is LoFi Hip Hop (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk).
