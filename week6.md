# Week 6

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I was introduced to the Daily Stand-up and project management for the upcoming assignment. After learning the basic steps of daily stand-ups, I wanted to know more detail about its practices and methods.

This Youtube video is a great real-life demonstration of an unacceptable stand-up meeting, compared to an acceptable one.

This article explains daily stand-ups in detail and describes how these meetings work in a particular company.

I also wanted to revise on the Agile framework since it would be beneficial for team management in this project. the Sprint method can be effective for completing tasks in a short time.

## Estimated Hours

I spent about 1 hour 30 mins on learning activities.

## Content Insights

I noticed that the project management tools needed for the assignment had aspects of the Agile framework. With prior experience with Agile, it is an effective framework for development and I am happy to use it again. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

The Youtube demonstration video was more suited toward an industry-level project with 5+ members. It was insightful to see the methods used to organise a stand-up meeting for a large team. The upcoming project will include smaller versions of daily stand-up. This will prepare me for meetings and projects in industry.
